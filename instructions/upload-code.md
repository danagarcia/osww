# Uploading the Code

### Have you completed the Prerequisites?
- [No? Find them in the README](../README.md#prerequisites)

## Flashing your microcontroller

1. Connect your Pi Pico
1. Open the `osww.ino` file in the Arduino IDE
1. Ensure the project compiles first; click on **Sketch > Verify/Compile**
    - If you see the following, all is OK:
        ```
        Sketch uses 90822 bytes (4%) of program storage space. Maximum is 2097152 bytes.
        Global variables use 42888 bytes (15%) of dynamic memory, leaving 227448 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 270336 bytes.
        ```
1. Upload the code; **Sketch > Upload**
    - If you see the following, all is OK:
